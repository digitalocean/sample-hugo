The Hugo Kiera theme now supports featured images. To use the feature, set the `images` parameter in a page's frontmatter.

(Note that this is required to be an array, even though only the first image is used. This is to provide compatability with the built-in [Twitter Card](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#twitter-cards) shortcode.)
