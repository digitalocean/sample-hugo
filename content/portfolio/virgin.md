#### Re-imagining the airport lounge of the future

In response to the romance of air travel being slowly drained, Virgin were determined to create a compelling air lounge service experience for travellers.

My role was to create a service layer that challenged the accepted convention of sterile, impersonal airport lounges and to bring the glamour back to travel.

​A future state service was created through a number of stakeholder workshops and customer interviews I facilitated. Personas were developed to reflect a more diverse set of customers, behaviours, and expectations on service. A picture of a new clubhouse experience was built up through a new service experience map, that reframed luxury for travellers using the clubhouse. 

​It was not just the front of house service touch-points that were mapped, but also the capabilities of staff and processes were tested from different perspectives. For example, balancing the commercially viability of the new services were tested with the commercial team.

The new clubhouse was launched in San Francisco and customer response has seen it become the most popular Virgin Lounge
