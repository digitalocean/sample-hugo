Arranging a mortgage can be a slow, difficult, and emotionally draining. One of the UK’s largest mortgage providers realised this and wanted to rethink how it could be done better.

Working with senior stakeholders and customers, I mapped out the existing mortgage journey – capturing the business processes, regulation requirements, and the customers' thoughts and feelings at every step. From this service map I worked with a team of designers and stakeholders in the business to identify painpoints.

The focus for the sprint was on creating a flexible dialogue between staff and customers to navigate the process. Through prototyping and research we uncovered the barrier created with customers towards the legal language used. From this insight, a simplified and customer friendly process was created and tested with stakeholders and customers.
