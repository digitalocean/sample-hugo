A service design project with Vodafone Innovation team to explore and develop a service aimed at urban bike, & moped commuters to track their vehicles from their smart phone, giving them greater sense of security.

​With commuters exploring new forms of mobility in cities, the task was to deliver a service that would allow commuters to track their urban vehicle from their mobile device. 

​The service, **Bikexone**, comprised of a connected tracking device, embedded in a LED light, that attached to a bicylce or moped.

Lightweight and rechargeable, the bikexone GPS tracking device provided instant access to the location of a customer's bike via the bikexone iOS app. The intelligent, bike-mounted alarm system recognises when it’s owner leave their bike’s vicinity and automatically activates, reassuring them that their bike is always protected

​
My role encompassed exploring the opportunity areas, setting the strategic direction, conducting user research, guiding the internal development teams, and managing hardware suppliers.

​

The initial service was launched in 5 European markets
