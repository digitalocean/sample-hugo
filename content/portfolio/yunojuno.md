YunoJuno is one of the UK's leading marketplace for creative and tech freelancers. Changes by the UK Government on the hiring process of freelancers was going to have a big impact on YunoJuno’s business going forward.

The opportunity to redesign the business to involved working with YunoJuno senior management team to understand the implications of this by engaging with their senior customers.

​Through a number of user interviews I was able to identify key areas for YunoJuno to create new service propositions that would help them address the needs of their customers.

The result was a new value proposition for YunoJuno to offer a service as a Umbrella Company and thereby retain and grow its customer base.
